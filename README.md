This repository tracks my <b>active and ongoing practice</b> in <b>Object-Oriented Programming using C++</b>.
I am focused on building <b>strong fundamentals</b> by writing clean, structured code and continuously improving it as I progress.

</p>



<h2>Purpose</h2>



<p>

My goal is to deeply understand how C++ programs are designed using classes and objects. This repository represents a <b>long-term learning journey</b>, where I focus on clarity, structure, and refinement rather than rushing through concepts.

</p>

<p>C++ is a powerful language, and Object-Oriented Programming is at the core of building scalable and maintainable software.  

This repository is my space to:</p>

<br>

<p>- Strengthen my understanding of <b>classes, objects, and encapsulation</b> </p>

<p>- Practice writing <b>clear, readable, and well-structured code</b> </p>

<p>- Apply best practices instead of rushed or copy-paste solution</p>



<h2>What you’ll find here</h2>

<ul>
  
&nbsp; <li>Practical C++ programs based on core OOP concepts</li>
&nbsp; <li>Code written with clean structure and clear intent</li>
&nbsp; <li>Continuous refactoring as my understanding improves</li>
&nbsp; <li>Learning aligned with modern C++ practices and the Microsoft C++ course series</li>

</ul>




<h2>Progress & mindset</h2>



<p>
